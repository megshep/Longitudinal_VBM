This includes all of the MATLAB and shell scripts required for each stage of a longitudinal VBM for a sample of 1,217 adolescents across 3 timepoints.

1. For the serial longitudinal registration, I submitted the serial_reg_csf.m script and the submit_serial.sh
2. For the segmentation, I submitted segment.m and segment_avg.sh
